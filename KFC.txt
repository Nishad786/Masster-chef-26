The Real Secret Ingredient
According to Ron Douglas, author of America’s Most Wanted Recipes, the real key to the perfect crispy texture is one thing: monosodium glutamate (MSG). You can add this into your seasoning mix before breading or sprinkle it on the chicken after frying. Regardless, it’s a must. And don’t worry—MSG isn’t harmful to you in any way.

How to Get Perfect KFC-Style Chicken
Some insist that you should let the coated chicken sit before frying. Not at KFC. Their rule is “from flour to fryer.”

Bread your chicken by first dipping in an egg-milk wash then dipping in the secret spice blend mixed with two cups of flour. From there, go right into the fryer. If you allow the breading to sit on the chicken for too long, you might get soggy breading or breading that doesn’t stick to the chicken.

When it comes to frying, KFC relies on high temp, industrial-strength pressure friers to get that extra crispy coating. While you won’t be able at deep fry with your at home pressure cooker, you can still recreate the KFC crunch with a deep fryer, a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot. Simply heat your oil 350ºF and leave each piece in for exactly 12 minutes. If you’re worried about the chicken not being done, you can pop it into the oven for a few more minutes to heat it through (and maintain the crispy coating).

Never fried chicken before? Here’s a handy guide that’ll break it down, step by step.
